# Sparkify Project - Udacity Data Scientist
In this project, the objective is to create a model to detect the user who will potentially leave the music streaming service platform. It is a classical churn prediction problem.

### Requirements
- To run the project, you have to create an account in Databricks Community (Free tier with up to 6GB of space and unlimited time to use it)

- Just upload the dataset for this problem (provided by Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree) and you'll be able to run all the cells.
- No other python packages installs are needed

### Methodology
The project has been created mainly in a jupyter notebook within Databricks. There is also a blog post explaining a little bit more the steps performed during the modelling.

### Results
The model created is based on a decision tree classification algorithm. It has a 60% of recall score and 74% of F1 score.
